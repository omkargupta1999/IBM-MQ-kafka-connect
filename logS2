Subject : NEFT MQ Connectivity Issue – Channel Configuration Required

Hi Team,

We have completed Kafka Connect setup and both NEFT MQ Source and Sink connectors are running, but they are failing to connect to IBM MQ.

Observed Error (common for Source & Sink):
MQRC_UNKNOWN_CHANNEL_NAME (2540)
This indicates that the SVRCONN channels configured in Kafka Connect are not defined or not accessible on the MQ Queue Manager.

Details currently configured by us:
Queue Manager: SBI_NEFT
MQ Host: 10.176.10.213
Port: 2001
Source Channel: IPH.TO.SBIEPAY
Sink Channel: EPAY.TO.IPH
Connection mode: Client
TLS / User Auth: Not used

Request from MQ Team:
Please confirm:
Whether IPH.TO.SBIEPAY and EPAY.TO.IPH SVRCONN channels are created on SBI_NEFT
Channels are RUNNING and enabled for client connections
Channels are accessible from OpenShift network
Port 2001 listener is active for these channels
Once confirmed/fixed, we can immediately re-test end-to-end NEFT MQ ↔ Kafka flow.

Thanks,
Saadi
